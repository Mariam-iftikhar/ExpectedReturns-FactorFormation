# Expected Returns Factor Formation

This repository is the starting point for the Expected Returns Factor Formation project, part of a broader financial factor research initiative. The aim here is to build a comprehensive framework for creating financial factors that can be utilized in active portfolio management and factor analysis.

## üîç Project Description:

### üí° Objective:
The focus of this project is to develop a set of functions that allow for the construction of financial factors using data sources mentioned in the repository. Researchers will have the ability to input data and create factors that will aid in active portfolio management and quantitative finance analysis.

### üõ†Ô∏è Approach & Steps Taken:

‚û°Ô∏è Set Up and Loaded Required Packages:
   
- Start by setting up the R development environment and loading essential packages such as ExpectedReturns, FactorAnalytics, and tinytest to streamline factor construction, data processing, and testing.

‚û°Ô∏è API Configuration and Data Retrieval:
   
- Next, we shall access key financial datasets to gather the necessary financial data for factor construction.

- Pull data from various market databases and will ensure it is in a usable format for creating factors.

‚û°Ô∏è Data Management and Preprocessing:
   
- Develop tools for processing and cleaning financial data, including removing missing values and aligning data across different sources.

- This step ensures that the data is properly formatted for financial factor construction.

‚û°Ô∏è Develop Core Functions for Factor Construction:
   
- Craft functions to build financial factors from raw data sources.

- These functions help normalize and align financial time series data, ensuring that the factors are based on consistent inputs.

‚û°Ô∏è Testing the Factor Functions:
   
- Finally, we shall conduct unit testing for each function using the tinytest package to verify the reliability and accuracy of our factor construction methods.

‚û°Ô∏è Documentation:
   
- Put together detailed documentation for each function to make sure everything is clear regarding how to use them and where they apply.

- Include vignettes that showcase the process of constructing factors and validating them, sticking to the naming conventions typically used in factor analysis.

### üéØ Outcome:

The end result will be a collection of top-notch, reusable functions designed for building financial factors. These tools will enable researchers and finance professionals to efficiently create and analyze financial factors, ultimately leading to improved investment strategies and better management of portfolios.

### üìù Installation of Available Packages:

To get the ExpectedReturns and FactorAnalytics packages up and running on my local machine, ran this code:
```
library(remotes)
install_github("JustinMShea/ExpectedReturns")
install_github("braverock/FactorAnalytics") 
install_github("braverock/FactorAnalytics", force = TRUE) # updated version

```
### üîç Future Development:

Looking ahead, we plan to expand this project by adding more methods for factor construction and enhancing the documentation with additional test cases and usage examples.
